# Weather App 🌦️  

Welcome to the **Weather App** repository! This is a simple weather forecasting application that I built to practice and improve my front-end development and logic-building skills.  

## 🌐 Live Demo  
You can check out the live version of the app here:  
[Weather App - Live](https://weatherapp-connect-abdullah.netlify.app/)  

## 📌 Features  
- Displays the current weather conditions for any city.  
- Fetches weather data, including temperature, humidity, and weather description.  
- User-friendly and responsive design.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **HTML**: For structuring the application.  
- **CSS**: For styling and making it visually appealing.  
- **JavaScript**: For adding interactivity and fetching data from the API.  

## 🔗 API Integration  
This application uses the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to fetch real-time weather data for any location.  

## 🚀 How It Works  
1. Enter the name of the city in the input field.  
2. The app makes a request to the OpenWeather API.  
3. The fetched weather details are displayed on the screen.
